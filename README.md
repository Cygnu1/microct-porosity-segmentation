# microct-porosity-segmentation
Implementation of the methods for rock micro-CT analysis (Classification + Diffusion + Segmentation)

---

## Overview

This project presents a computational pipeline for image processing and analysis using
state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision and machine learning.

The proposed methodology is applied to domain-specific image data and aims to provide
a reproducible and extensible framework for experimentation.

---

## Repository Structure
There's a folder to each step of the method (Classification, diffusion, segmentation and visualizaton)

---

## Dataset
The datasets used in this work are not publicly available due to size and licensing
constraints. Instructions for reproducing the experiments are provided.

---

## Requirements
The requirements for the virtual env is available.
Diffusion, segmentation and visualization were done in requirements.txt
Classification was done in requirementsMamba.txt
